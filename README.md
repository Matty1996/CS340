# CS340Grazioso Salvare Animal Rescue Dashboard - Project Two

Reflection

How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

When I write code, I focus on keeping things simple and organized. 
For example, in the CRUD Python module I built in Project One, I made sure each function did just one job. 
This made it easier to connect the dashboard to the database in Project Two without having to change a bunch of things. 
Keeping the code clean and modular means I can easily update it or use it in other projects later on.

The benefit of writing code this way is that it’s easier to understand and work with, especially when you come back to it after a while.
It also makes it less likely to break when you need to add new features. 
In the future, I can take this same CRUD module and tweak it to work with other databases or projects.

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist?

When I tackle a problem, I break it down into smaller, more manageable pieces. 
For this project, I first figured out what the database and dashboard needed to do, then I focused on building each part step by step. 
This method helped me stay on track and made sure that everything would fit together smoothly in the end.

This project was a bit different from other assignments I’ve done because it required me to think about both the back-end (the database) and the front-end (the user interface). Moving forward, I’ll keep using this approach, making sure to focus on what the client needs and using tools like data visualization to make the final product as useful as possible.

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter?

Computer scientists solve problems by creating and improving software that makes life easier for people.
In this project, my work on the Grazioso Salvare dashboard helps the company quickly and easily manage their animal data, making it easier for them to find and train the best rescue dogs. 
By automating these tasks, we can save them a lot of time and reduce errors, which helps them focus on what really matters—saving lives.
